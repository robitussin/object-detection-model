# Description
A object detection model using a CNN to detect cats and dogs for demonstration purposes

This is an object detection model made to retrieve a dataset in Google Drive

In Google Drive, the folder structure of the dataset should be:

MyDrive/\
└── dataset/\
    ├── images/\
    │   ├── img001.jpg\
    │   ├── img002.jpg\
    │   └── ...\
    └── labels/\
        ├── img001.txt\
        ├── img002.txt\
        └── ...
