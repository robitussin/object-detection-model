# Description
A object detection model using a CNN to detect cats and dogs for demonstration purposes

This is an object detection model made to retrieve a dataset in Google Drive

In Google Drive, the folder structure of the dataset should be:

MyDrive/\
└── dataset/\
    ├── images/\
    │   ├── img001.jpg\
    │   ├── img002.jpg\
    │   └── ...\
    └── labels/\
        ├── img001.txt\
        ├── img002.txt\
        └── ...

# Model Training script
### model.ipynb
Use this to train a CNN model using the images from google drive and the labels generated.

## Annotation scripts
### manualannotation.ipynb
Use this to check if the manually generated labels are accurate. Images and labels are retrieved from the same project folder

#### manualannotation.ipynb
Use this to check if the manually generated labels are accurate

### yoloannotationlocal.ipynb
Use this to automatically generate annotations of each image in the dataset using YOLO. Images should be placed in the same project folder

### yoloannotationlocal.ipynb
Use this to automatically generate annotations of each image in the dataset using YOLO. Images should be placed in the same project folder

### yoloannotation(Google_Drive).ipynb
Use this to generate annotations using YOLO and the image dataset are uploaded in Google Drive

## Utility script
### textfilecleaner.ipynb
Use this to remove unwanted annotations generated by YOLO.
